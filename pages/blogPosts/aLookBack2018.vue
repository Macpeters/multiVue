    <h1>A Look Back - 2018</h1>
    <section>
      It's December 31, 2018, and it seems like a great time to take a look back at the past year, and 
      see what I've been up to, maybe think about what I'd like to do or experience in the coming year.  Take
      a look at my Instagram for more pics:

      <h2>New Ventures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Digital Paintings</h3>
            I've broken free of the physical world and taken my drawings into pixel land - it took a bit of getting 
            used to, but I've really begun to enjoy digital drawing/painting - for the colours, the cleanliness, and
            the ability to use layers and opacity. Almost all my drawings this year have been digital - from quick sketches
            to full fledged paintings.

          <h3><a href="/art/cartoons" title="Hidden Dreams Tarot">Cartoons</a></h3>
            It is said that 80% of the learning you do in a drawing happens in the first 20% of that drawing, and that
            to draw better, you should spend more time drawing quick sketches, rather than focussing the majority of your
            time on details.  To that end, I have been trying to focus my learning energy on quick sketches - cartoons, really.
            My attention has been on colour, tone, composition, and form - all the fundamentals.  I really think it's 
            been working for me, so I have every intention of continuing to do this.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Animation</h3>
            As part of my work in cartoons and quick sketches, I've been trying my hand at a little bit of animation.  I haven't
            taken any classes, and I really have no idea what I'm doing, but it's still pretty fun.  The very act of trying to 
            animate is giving me a fresh perspective on movement, which can hopefully make all my future art more dynamic and
            alive. 
        </li>
          
        <li>
          <h3>Live painting - Art for Heart</h3>
            I have done a bit of live painting, on the street or in a part, but this was the first time I painted in front
            of an audience.  It was both thrilling and nerve wracking.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Visionary Art Intensive</h3>
            I took this workshop at <a href="https://www.cosm.org/" target="_blank">COSM</a> - led by 
            <a href="https://www.alexgrey.com/" target="_blank">Alex Grey</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.allysongrey.com/" target="_blank">Allyson Grey</a>. They are strong leaders in the Visionary Art
            community, having met them, it's easy to see why.  They work tirelessy, and their vision is inspirational - which
            is why COSM has become a sort of Mecca for visionary artists around the world.  Every year I've taken a workshop there, 
            I've painted with some of the most amazing people I've ever met.  With Alex and Allyson at the helm, and giving
            personal feedback - there's really nothing I've come across that can compare with that kind of experience.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Hidden Dreams Tarot</h3>
            I started my own interpretation of the <a href="/tarot" title="tarot deck">major arcana tarot deck</a> years ago, when self-publishing was less of an option.  This year I finally 
            took this project over the finish line. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Cutie Pie Tarot</h3>
            In the midst of finishing up the Hidden Dreams Tarot, and practicing cartoons, I thought it might be a fun little extra
            to whip up a cartoon version of the deck - something cute, kid friendly, inclusive, and accessible.
