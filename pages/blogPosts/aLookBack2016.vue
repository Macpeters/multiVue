      <h2>New Ventures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Skateboard Art</h3>
            This started when I signed up for the Skate Art workshop at COSM - I went hunting around for used
            skateboard decks I could paint, and wound up with a whole handful from So Hip It Hurts on Queen Street.
            They are an odd shape, which makes them interesting to paint.  They are small, and solid wood, so I can just chill out on 
            my couch or in a park while painting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Spraypaint/Aerosol</h3>
             For practice, I spent some time spray painting scrap wood outside - I'd leave it, hoping to find the same
             wood there next time, so I could practice some more, but people kept stealing it.  I ran out of wood, eventually, 
             but there's always more construction going on, so who knows?
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Airbrush</h3>
            I had been wanting to try out airbrush for a long time.  It's expensive to get into - between the airbrush itself,
            a compressor, any cleaners and special paints you need.  Since I had been working a while as a software dev, I found
            I could actually afford to try it out.  There's definitely a learning curve, but so many possibilities.
        </li>

          <h3>Visionary Skate art and Grafitti Workshop</h3>
            I took this workshop at <a href="https://www.cosm.org/" target="_blank">COSM</a> - led by 
            <a href="http://positivecreations.ca/" target="_blank">Chris Dyer</a>.  This was my first trip
            to COSM - it's a beautiful place to paint, and the artists taking the workshop with me were super skilled
            and friendly.  I really loved the small size of the class, because it gave me a better chance to connect
            with people, and I got a lot of worthwhile feedback from Chris.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Neon Jungle</h3>
            I've been painting on raw unstretched canvas for years - creating festival art.  This year I wanted to
            end that, but with a bang.  I had a piece of canvas that was 9X12 feet - and it was going to be a single painting.
            Since I couldn't hang it all at once, I had to paint it in pieces, with the part I wasn't working on folded up.  It 
            was quite a task.  I think if I'm going to do anything large scale in the future, it's going to be on a wall, with 
            a ladder.
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Public Art</h3>
            This year I tried to get involved in public art - I did a couple of murals in the Alleyway of 
            Dreams (near Main and Danforth), and I participated in a group Mosaic project around Coxwell and
            Danforth.
